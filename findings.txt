The difficulty of the three mystery Sudoku boards were identified by
counting the number of recursive calls made by the solve_board function:

Hard difficulty: Mystery 3 board – 14,134 recursions
Extremely hard difficulty: Mystery 1 board – 421,547 recursions
Impossible: Mystery 2 board – no solution exists

Generally, easier puzzles, with more initial clues, require fewer recursive
calls due to less backtracking. Harder puzzles have fewer initial clues so
require more recursive attempts and backtracking. In unsolvable puzzles,
the algorithm exhausts all possibilities. However, using recursion count as
a measure of difficulty may not be reliable when the Sudoku boards being
compared are more similar in difficulty than the ones used here.
Recursion count reflects the process of the algorithm, which attempts to
solve the puzzle by trying every possible number at each empty position
(until a solution is found), progressing through the grid systematically.
This brute-force approach is very different to how a human would logically
approach a Sudoku puzzle. Therefore, recursion count cannot reflect the
true difficulty of a puzzle, although it can offer an estimate.
